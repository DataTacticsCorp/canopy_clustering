clustering
==========

helper files and demo for modified canopy clustering

canopy.R contains code to demo the rest of the code

simulations.R creates fake data, and writes the distance function

stsscale.R creates a fast approximation of 2d scaling

sparsify.R is a helper function that takes a matrix and makes it "long"
form (i,j,a(i,j)) 

convertcolor.R is a helper function that converts a vector to a gradient
used for plotting color
